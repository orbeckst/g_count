Compatibility with Gromacs
==========================

Every version of Gromacs introduces some changes that lead to some
incompatibilities. Therefore, there are specific version of gridcount
for different versions of Gromacs.

The gridcount  version that comes with this file is for stable

    Gromacs 4.5.x

releases (specifically, 4.5.3 was tested).

Other version of gridcount can be found on the website (see README).




Installation and Compilation 
============================

In order to compile the code you need to have the Gromacs include
files and libgmx and libmd installed.

In order to compile the programs in this directory on their own you
will need an existing gromacs installation, i.e. the header files and
the libmd and libgmx libraries.

(0) Figure out where Gromacs is installed on your system; you need to
    know the full path to the include directory and to the library
    directory.

    1. include directory: The directory that contains the files
       xtcio.h, gmx_ana.h, atomprop.h, ...

       On a default installation of Gromacs this would be 
       '/usr/local/gromacs/include/gromacs'.

    2. lib directory: The directory that contains the files
       libgmx.a or libgmx.so or libgmx.dylib

       On a default installation of Gromacs this would be
       '/usr/local/gromacs/lib'.

(1) Edit 'Makefile':
    
    1. Set 'GMX_INCLUDE_DIR' to the include directory found in Step 0.1

    2. Set 'GMX_LIB_DIR' to the library dirctory found in Step 0.2

    3. Set 'BIN_DIR' to a directory where you want to install the compiled
       binaries; you will need write access to the directory.

    `make help' shows your current settings.

    `make check' tries to determine if you set the variables
    correctly; please read the output carefully.

(2) Compile the programs
    
       make

(3)  Install
      
       make install

Example:

You can also forego editing the top-level Makefile and set important
paths on the command line. For instance, if you installed Gromacs in
/opt/gromacs then you would (probably) say

  make GMX_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/gromacs/include/gromacs GMX_LIB_DIR=/opt/gromacs/lib

and then install it in your private bin directory

  make BIN_DIR=$HOME/bin install

(For more detailed explanations see the top of the top-level Makefile.)
